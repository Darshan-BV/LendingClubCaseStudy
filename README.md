# Lending club case study
>Consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company must make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision after accepting the loan application.

>Non-Default: Applicant is likely to repay the loan, 
              then not approving the loan results in
              a loss of business to the company.

>Default:     If the applicant is not likely 
              to repay the loan,  i.e. he/she is likely
              to default, then approving the loan 
              may lead to a financial loss for the 
              company.
